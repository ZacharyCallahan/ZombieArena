Well hello there!

If you are wanting to create a new Schematic for the arena. Which I highly don't recommend, although you can, but the plugin may have bugs! There may be a future update
to allow this to work more smoothly!

Please make sure that when you create the Schematic you are standing where you want them to spawn. If you do not then their spawn point will be
all sorts of messed up and could lead to the player dying.

Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this. One more thing though also make sure the name
of the Schematic is "ZombieArena".

Have a good day!
