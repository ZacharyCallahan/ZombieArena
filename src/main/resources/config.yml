# Wave-Spawn-Rate is the rate at a zombie will spawn during the first wave! (Ex. If the spawn rate is "2" a zombie will spawn every 2 Seconds)
# Wave-Length is how long the way will last. (Seconds)
# Spawn-Chance - Chance is out of all chances added up (Ex. if regular-mob is 50 and speed-mob-level-one is 50. They would have 50/100 chance of spawning)
